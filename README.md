##Installation

1.  Make sure you have Python 3.6.0 installed. See instructions for download here:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/

    machines, youâ€™ll probably want to use it there, too.

3.  Requirements.txt contains all the external dependencies for the api.

4.  Go into the project's root folder and follow the "How to Run" instructions below.
